Context-Snoopiest is an advanced architecture designed to maintain context and character consistency in AI-generated video narratives. By leveraging intelligent chunking strategies, context management engines, and agentic workflows, it solves the "amnesia" problem often found in long-form generative video content.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is broken down into several core components documented in detail:

### Core Engine
- **[Chunking Strategy](https://bishalg.github.io/Context-Snoopiest/chunking)**: How narratives are broken down into manageable, consistency-preserving segments.
- **[Context Engine](https://bishalg.github.io/Context-Snoopiest/context-management)**: The brain of the system that manages state, memory, and narrative flow across chunks.
- **[Character Consistency](https://bishalg.github.io/Context-Snoopiest/character-consistency)**: Techniques and pipelines ensuring visual and behavioral fidelity of characters throughout the video.

### Implementation
- **[Workflows](https://bishalg.github.io/Context-Snoopiest/workflows)**: detailed workflows for the generation pipeline.
- **[Agentic Workflow](https://bishalg.github.io/Context-Snoopiest/agentic-workflow)**: How AI agents collaborate to execute the generation tasks.
- **[Roadmap](https://bishalg.github.io/Context-Snoopiest/roadmap)**: Future development plans and features.

### Technology
- **[Tech Stack](https://bishalg.github.io/Context-Snoopiest/tech-stack)**: frameworks, libraries, and tools used.
