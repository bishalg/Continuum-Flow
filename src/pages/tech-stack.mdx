### The AI Model Zoo (Execution Layer)

We utilize a Best-in-Class Modular Approach rather than a single provider. This prevents vendor lock-in and allows upgrading specific components (e.g., swapping the Image Generator without breaking the Text Analyzer).

> [!NOTE]
> **Cost Analysis**: A detailed breakdown of the costing layer is available in the [Cost Estimator](/cost-estimator).

| Component | Model Selected | Provider | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic / Text** | **[Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/)** | [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/) | Superior reasoning capabilities and larger context window (200k) for analyzing full chapters. |
| **Image Gen** | **[Flux.1 [Dev]](https://blackforestlabs.ai/)** | [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) / [Fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) | Currently beats [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) in prompt adherence and text rendering. |
| **Video Gen** | **[Luma Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine)** | [Luma API](https://lumalabs.ai/) | High temporal coherence. Relies on "Keyframe" feature for control. |
| **Audio / TTS** | **[ElevenLabs (Turbo v2)](https://elevenlabs.io/)** | [ElevenLabs API](https://elevenlabs.io/api) | Low latency and highest emotional range. |
| **Lip Sync** | **[SyncLabs](https://synclabs.so/) / [SadTalker](https://github.com/OpenTalker/SadTalker)** | API / Local | Decoupled lip-syncing ensures we can perfect audio performance before mapping to video. |

### Advanced Document Management

We treat the screenplay not just as text, but as **executable documentation**.

#### The Quarto (QMD) Pipeline

1.  **Source**: `Chapter_01.md` (Raw Text).
2.  **Processing**: The Agent converts this into `Script_01.qmd` (Quarto Markdown).
3.  **Metadata Injection**: The Agent embeds JSON metadata (Camera angles, Lighting) inside YAML headers or hidden code blocks within the QMD.
4.  **Render**:
    *   **For Humans**: Quarto renders a clean PDF looking like a Hollywood script (Courier font, proper indentation).
    *   **For Robots**: The system parses the underlying JSON data blocks from the same file to drive the video generator.

> [!TIP]
> **Single Source of Truth**: The readable PDF script reviewed by humans is the exact same code that generates the video.

### Audio & Lip Sync Architecture

Professional production requires **Decoupling**. We generally avoid "all-in-one" generators to maintain granular control over performance.

*   **Step 1: Audio Production (The Radio Play)**
    *   Generate full audio track using ElevenLabs.
    *   **Forced Alignment**: Use tools like Gentle or OpenAI Whisper to get exact timing of every word.
*   **Step 2: Video Generation (The Silent Film)**
    *   Generate the 8-second video visuals based on the visual prompt.
*   **Step 3: The Sync Pass (Post-Process)**
    *   **Lip-Sync**: Run Video + Audio through a dedicated Sync engine (Wav2Lip/SyncLabs).

### 5. Asset Management: "The Cloud-Local Mirror"

Team collaboration on 50GB+ video projects is challenging. We solve this with a "Split-Brain" storage strategy.

#### Storage Strategy

*   **Code & Scripts**: `GitHub` (.md, .qmd, .json) - Version controlled, lightweight.
*   **Heavy Assets**: `AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2` (.mp4, .png, .wav) - Cheap object storage.

#### The Sync Mechanism (`npm run asset:sync`)

1.  Cloud Worker renders video -> Uploads to S3 -> Pushes Manifest to Database.
2.  Local CLI detects new manifest.
3.  **Node.js `fs`** generates folder structure locally matching the Chapter/Scene hierarchy.
4.  Pulls only the new video files to your local folder.

### 6. Execution Environment

| Task | Environment | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Writing / Logic** | **Cloud (Anthropic)** | Requires massive GPU/TPU for LLM reasoning. |
| **Folder Gen / Management** | **Local (Node.js)** | Fast file system operations; zero latency UI updates. |
| **Image/Video Rendering** | **Cloud (Replicate)** | Requires A100 GPUs. Too slow/hot to run on local MacBook. |
| **Final Assembly** | **Hybrid** | FFmpeg WASM for quick previews; Cloud Lambda for 4K export. |
